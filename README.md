# Demand Forecasting using Time Series Models

## Overview
This project focuses on demand forecasting at a granular level (Store ID × Product ID) using multiple time series and machine learning models. The goal is to build baseline models, systematically fine-tune them, and perform a fair comparison using standard evaluation metrics.
The pipeline is designed to be:
* Modular
* Interpretable
* Research-paper ready
* Industry-aligned


## Objectives
* Preserve store-level and product-level granularity
* Implement baseline forecasting models
* Perform step-by-step fine-tuning for each model
* Compare baseline vs fine-tuned models
* Identify the best-performing model per Store–Product
* Provide a clean evaluation using MAPE and R²
