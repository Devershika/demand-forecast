# Demand Forecasting using Time Series Models

## Overview
This project focuses on demand forecasting at a granular level (Store ID × Product ID) using multiple time series and machine learning models. The goal is to build baseline models, systematically fine-tune them, and perform a fair comparison using standard evaluation metrics.
The pipeline is designed to be:
* Modular
* Interpretable
* Research-paper ready
* Industry-aligned
